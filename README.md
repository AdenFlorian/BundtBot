# BundtBot
### Introduction
Hi I am Bundt

### Setup
Download the zip file from the releases tab, and extract the folder inside (should be named BundtBot*) to your computer somewhere. Create a file called "BotToken.txt" in the keys folder, and put your bot token in there. Go here to get a bot token: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me. Also, bot tokens need a `Bot ` prefix now. Here is an example of what should be in your BotToken.txt:
```
Bot zTg4zzzzzDI3OTYzNDc2ODY0.zzzzzg.fpzzztS5d6y9YhaQFiczzzddzyI
```

### Configuration
There are some settings you can configure in the BundtBot.exe.config:
- CommandPrefix: Will determine the prefix used for commands.

### Joining servers
Use this link to add your bot to servers that you are an owner of. You must replace the `BOT_CLIENT_ID` part with your bot's client id which you get from here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me.
