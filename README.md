# DiscordSharp_Starter
Just a little project to get you starting

I recommend you using discordsharp-v0.6.0.67-dev.

This project uses DiscordSharp by LuigiFan, get it [here](https://github.com/Luigifan/DiscordSharp)

If you want any help, or if you just want to contact me, join my [discord server!](https://discord.gg/0oZpaYcAjfvkDuE4) :)

## Things it has to do:
- [x] Check if a channel message has been received, and respond to that
- [x] Check if a private message has been received, and respond to that
- [x] Join a channel after receiving a "join *inviteurl*" private message
- [x] [BONUS!] Generate a number based on a string, so everytime the same number will be returned for the same string.
